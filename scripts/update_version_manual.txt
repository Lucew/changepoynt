# Install the build package to test build locally
pip install --upgrade build

# build the package locally to check whether it works
python -m build

# update the version in:
./setup.py
./pyproject.toml

# make a commit with message: (publish attempt) at the end
# this will run the publishing pipeline

# if the pipeline has been successful and the package is published on PyPi
# add a tag to the current commit in the form: vX.X.X (e.g., v0.1.0) to mark the version

# then do a release on GitHub with title "Published Version X.X.X" (e.g., Published Version 0.1.0)
# and put the release notes in the description
